# Cost Benefit Analysis and Tricky Valuations

**TLDR: Put a dollar number on it (or better a range), use whitepapers and case studies, and co-create your valuations.**

---

So recently I've been having some chat with people at work about the importance of understanding the value of the things we do. Specifically about being able to measure and articulate that value, as it's a such a powerful way to demonstrate impact. All businesses care about their financials in the end, so that's by far the most common unit of measurement of value.

So if we're coming up with a business case, we can gather historical data or forecasts, use some educated assumptions, and come up with an estimate of the profit over some period, or the Net Present Value. If we're really clever, we can do some ranges - perhaps a low, mid and high case.

Say for example we're looking at launching a new product. We'll have an idea of unit cost, fixed cost, margin, sales numbers, and potentially second-order effects like increases/decreases to sales from other products we may have. Sure it's hard to estimate sales numbers, but we may even already have historical data on prior product launches, either our own or external parties, that we can use as a reference. That's not too bad.

But what I've come across in the past are situations where it is very difficult to try to make that conversion into dollars.

Take for example, trying to put a value on implementing a proper Data Platform for your growing business. Your Data Platform does not directly increase sales, and it may even take a while to start providing benefit as parts of the business will take time to migrate over, and to get used to doing things there. So how do you even come up with a way to value this? Is this even the approach we should take, if we want to convince decision-makers that this is worth investing in?

So after a fair amount of Googling and ChatGPT-ing, my conclusion is - very likely yes, you do want to come up with a dollar value - I'd estimate in 90% of cases. Some of those valuations might be dubious, but they're better than not having a value at all.

Some tips I've gleaned on this:

- **Something is better than nothing**. Yeah doing an estimation might be hard and it might feel like the error bars are so large that it's not worth trying - but a really rough estimation might take less than an hour to do and get a range for. Perhaps the error bars aren't as big as you'd have thought, or perhaps just the exercise will prompt some additional value levers that are easier to work with.
- **Making use of other people/organisation's work - like whitepapers and case studies**. Whitepapers that make a connection between implementing these types of opportunity enablement initiatives, claiming to unlock billions in value - and then applying some hefty discounts because not all of them will be realised, some will overlap, some may be far in the future etc. Same goes for if there are case studies of these types of projects - they can be used as a baseline, and you apply and tweak assumptions from there.
- **If people question your methodology, co-create the valuation with them**. Especially if they are a relevant decision maker! Apart from this just generally being a good idea to ensure that you haven't missed anything or been overly optimistic/sceptical with your assumptions, people are more willing to accept the final outcome if they've been a process of making it happen. Taking the time and energy to seek their collaboration might seem difficult, but is it harder than coming up with as solid of a value case without their input, and *then* having to try win them over with it?
