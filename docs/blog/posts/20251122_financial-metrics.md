# Financial Metrics

For someone working in the 'Management Consulting' industry, I feel like my understanding of financials is a bit patchy. So this page is my attempt at patching my knowledge around financial metrics. Here goes!

## Gross Domestic Product (GDP)

**GDP** is the typical metric for the **economic growth** of an economy [3].

*"The shallowness of GDP thinking had already become evident in the 2000s"* [1]

Some GDP figures (2024, $US) [2]:

- Global total: $111.3 Tr
- USA: $29.2 Tr (26% of global)
- China: $18.7 Tr (17% of global)
- Germany: $4.7 Tr (4.2% of global)
- Japan: $4.0 Tr
- India: $3.9 Tr
- UK: $3.6 Tr
- France: $3.1 Tr
- Australia: $1.8 Tr

## Consumer Price Index (CPI)

**CPI** is a measure of **inflation** (specifically its change per period), calculated as the cost of a 'market basket' of goods and services [1].

Target inflation in the US is 2% [2], and in Australia is 2-3% [1].

## Gini Coefficient / Index

The **Gini Coefficient** is a measure of **income inequality**, and takes values from 0 to 1. Values closer to 0 indicate greater income equality, values closer to 1 indicate greater income inequality [1].

In FY23, Australia's Gini Coefficient was 0.307 [3].

Selected values by country, highest to lowest (latest update year) [2]:

- South Africa: 0.630 (2014)
- Namibia: 0.591 (2015)
- Colombia: 0.539 (2023)
- Brazil: 0.516 (2023)
- Singapore: 0.458 (2016)
- United States: 0.418 (2023)
- Germany: 0.324 (2020)
- United Kingdom: 0.324 (2021)
- Australia: 0.307 (2023) [3]
- Canada: 0.299 (2020)
- India: 0.255 (2022)
- Slovakia: 0.241 (2022)

## Market Capitalisation (Market Cap)

**Market Cap** is a measure of the total value of a company, calculated as the market price per share, multiplied by total number of outstanding shares. This calculation is more complex for private companies. Market Cap is generally considered an efficient reflection of a public company's value based on all publicly available information, and is seen as a reflection of current and historical performance.

Largest companies by Market Cap as of Aug 2025 ($US) [2]:

1. Nvidia: $4.23 Tr
2. Microsoft: $3.77 Tr
3. Apple: $3.45 Tr
4. Alphabet: $2.58 Tr
5. Amazon: $2.44 Tr
6. Meta: $1.86 Tr
7. Saudi Arabian Oil Co.: $1.53 Tr
8. Broadcom: $1.4 Tr
9. Berkshire Hathaway: $1.09 Tr
10. Tesla: $1.08 Tr

Selected Mining companies [3]:

- Rio Tinto: $115 B
- Zijin Mining: $115 B
- Southern Copper: $107 B
