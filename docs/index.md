# Howdy, it's JJ

<!-- *A blog by Ja-Jet Loh* -->

I like to learn. I learn well by creating content. Maybe one day videos and such, but for now by writing. Writing's also probably a lot more time-efficient. Also helps me to organise me thought a bit better - so hopefully these pages are *More Organised Than My Brain*.

I'll be using this space to write about whatever I want, but probably focused on things I'm learning and thinking about. Like Facebook in the early days. Or maybe like a longer-form Twitter. I've never really used Twitter, so I wouldn't know.

Enjoy!
