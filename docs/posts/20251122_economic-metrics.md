# Economic Metrics

For someone working in the 'Management Consulting' industry, I feel like my understanding of economics is a bit patchy. So this page is my attempt at patching my knowledge around economic metrics. Here goes!

## Gross Domestic Product (GDP)

**GDP** is the typical metric for the **economic growth** of an economy [3].

*"The shallowness of GDP thinking had already become evident in the 2000s"* [1]

Some GDP figures (2024, $US) [2]:

- Global total: $111.3 Tr
- USA: $29.2 Tr (26% of global)
- China: $18.7 Tr (17% of global)
- Germany: $4.7 Tr (4.2% of global)
- Japan: $4.0 Tr
- India: $3.9 Tr
- UK: $3.6 Tr
- France: $3.1 Tr
- Australia: $1.8 Tr

## Consumer Price Index (CPI)

**CPI** is a measure of **inflation** (specifically its change per period), calculated as the cost of a 'market basket' of goods and services [1].

Target inflation in the US is 2% [2], and in Australia is 2-3% [1].

## Gini Coefficient / Index

The **Gini Coefficient** is a measure of **income inequality**, and takes values from 0 to 1. Values closer to 0 indicate greater income equality, values closer to 1 indicate greater income inequality [1].

In FY23, Australia's Gini Coefficient was 0.307 [3].

Selected values by country, highest to lowest (latest update year) [2]:

- South Africa: 0.630 (2014)
- Namibia: 0.591 (2015)
- Colombia: 0.539 (2023)
- Brazil: 0.516 (2023)
- Singapore: 0.458 (2016)
- United States: 0.418 (2023)
- Germany: 0.324 (2020)
- United Kingdom: 0.324 (2021)
- Australia: 0.307 (2023) [3]
- Canada: 0.299 (2020)
- India: 0.255 (2022)
- Slovakia: 0.241 (2022)
