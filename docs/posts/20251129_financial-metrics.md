# Financial Metrics

Similar to my page on Economic Metrics, I feel similarly patchy with my knowledge on Financial metrics. Hopefully writing this page will help!

## Profitability

These metrics help answer the question of **"How well are expenses used to generate profit?"**.

Profitability is the most straightforward type of metric to understand the rationale for. All firms need to be profitable to operate - or have very generous sponsors.

### Gross Profit Margin

$$
\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \frac{\text{Revenue} - \text{COGS}}{\text{Revenue}}
$$

### Net Profit Margin

$$
\text{Net Profit Margin} = \frac{\text{Revenue} - \text{COGS} - \text{Expenses} - \text{Interest} - \text{Taxes}}{\text{Revenue}}
$$

## Liquidity

Liquidity refers to the ability of a business to meet short-term financial obligations, such as loan repayments and accounts payable. Why does this matter? Because if you can't meet those obligations, you either need to do something like taking a loan, selling assets, raise equity to meet them, or default on them.

### Cash Ratio

$$\text{Cash Ratio} = \frac{\text{Cash} + \text{Short-Term Investments}}{\text{Current Liabilities}}$$

Along with the Quick Ratio and Current Ratio, these three metrics are snapshots in time of a company's liquidity. The Cash Ratio is the most conservative as it only includes the most liquid of assets.

The Cash Ratio alongside Quick and Current Ratios all share some commonalities:

- They are calculated over some time interval - usually annually when comparing across companies, though smaller time scale may be used in specific cases
- Ratios are not comparable between each other if they are calculated over different time periods
- Values above 1 are good, below 1 are bad. 1 is generally used as a threshold
- Values that are too high may indicate that capital isn't being utilised in the most efficient way, so higher is not necessarily better past a point

### Quick Ratio

Also known as the Acid-Test Ratio.

$$\text{Cash Ratio} = \frac{\text{Cash} + \text{Short-Term Investments} + \text{Accounts Receivable}}{\text{Current Liabilities}}$$

A little less conservative than the Cash Ratio as we also include Accounts Receivable.

### Current Ratio

$$\text{Current Ratio} = \frac{\text{Current Assets}}{\text{Current Liabilities}}$$

The **Current Ratio** is the least conservative of the three ratios, as it also includes certain assets that are more difficult to convert into cash. Things that may be included here but not in the Quick Ratio include:

- Raw materials
- Finished goods
- Short-term advances
- Refundable deposits

## Cash Flow

For me, Cash Flow metrics seem like they serve a similar purpose to Profitability - they deal with "money in vs. money out".

### Operating Cash Flow

$$\text{OCF} = \text{Net Income} - \text{Non-Cash Expenses} - \text{Increase in Working Capital}$$

So OCF tells us if operations is able to sustain itself, and we don't consider other CapEx spending or funding sources.

### Market Capitalisation (Market Cap)

**Market Cap** is a measure of the total value of a company, calculated as the market price per share, multiplied by total number of outstanding shares. This calculation is more complex for private companies. Market Cap is generally considered an efficient reflection of a public company's value based on all publicly available information, and is seen as a reflection of current and historical performance.
