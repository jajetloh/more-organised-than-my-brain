## Market Capitalisation (Market Cap)

**Market Cap** is a measure of the total value of a company, calculated as the market price per share, multiplied by total number of outstanding shares. This calculation is more complex for private companies. Market Cap is generally considered an efficient reflection of a public company's value based on all publicly available information, and is seen as a reflection of current and historical performance.
